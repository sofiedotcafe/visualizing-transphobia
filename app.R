# `file.copy` is overridden to prevent copying file permissions, which causes "Permission denied" errors on NixOS and similar immutable systems.
# The patch provided in the pull requests does not work because it does not patch the SASS precompiler package.
# I didn't want to deal with patching the SASS precompiler package, so I just override the `file.copy` function. >:3

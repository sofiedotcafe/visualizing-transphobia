# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This project is committed to fostering a respectful, affirming, and harm-aware environment for all contributors, especially trans, nonbinary, intersex, and gender-diverse people.  
We explicitly reject transphobia, medical pseudoscience, and any discourse that undermines the dignity, autonomy, or humanity of trans individuals.

## Expected Behavior

Contributors must:

- Treat all individuals with respect and empathy, regardless of gender identity or expression.
- Acknowledge trans people as experts in their own lives and bodies.
- Use affirming and accurate language regarding gender, transition, and healthcare.
- Base claims in peer-reviewed evidence and lived experience, not ideology or political propaganda.
- Understand the impact of structural oppression, especially in medicine, law, and media.

## Prohibited Behavior

The following will not be tolerated:

- Misgendering, deadnaming, or invalidating trans identities.
- Promoting or linking to anti-trans pseudoscience (e.g. “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria,” Blanchardian typologies, “desistance” panic).
- Framing anti-trans pseuodoscience as "evidence based".
- Harassment, gaslighting, tone-policing, or dismissing survivor testimony.
- “Both-sides” discourse that treats transphobic ideology as legitimate debate.
- Dismissing the rights of trans youth to receive evidence-based, affirming care.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers reserve the right to:

- Remove content, comments, or code that violate this policy
- Ban contributors or collaborators engaging in hate or pseudoscience
- Reject contributions that perpetuate transphobic frames, even if subtly worded or sourced from “respectable” institutions

## Protecting Our Communities

We recognize that:

- Many forms of anti-trans harm are structural and embedded in academic, legal, and medical systems.
- Transphobia often hides behind appeals to "concern," "objectivity," or "just asking questions."
- Trans safety and autonomy are non-negotiable.

## Reporting Violations

To report violations or raise concerns:

- Use GitHub’s [report abuse tool](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse)
- Or contact the maintainers confidentially as listed in the `README.md`
